This project is a smart digital receipt and payment platform that replaces paper bills with a unified, mobile‑first experience. Customers can scan a QR to instantly receive receipts, track expenses, view history in a calendar, manage pending dues, and get reminders for recurring bills — all in one place.
Merchants can generate receipts, manage pending payments (khata), send payment reminders, and receive UPI payments directly into their own accounts. Once a customer pays, the receipt is automatically marked as paid and both sides are notified. The goal is to simplify everyday transactions, reduce paper waste, and create a seamless bridge between billing, payments, and expense tracking.
